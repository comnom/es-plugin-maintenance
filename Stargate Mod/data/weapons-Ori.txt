	description "The central beam weapon of an Ori warship was an extremely powerful weapon that discharged fiery blasts from a central dish located at the front of the vessel. The beam fired by this weapon was capable of destroying a Ha'tak with a single strike, piercing its shield and ripping through the vessel while still retaining some power. The Ha'taks were completely useless against Ori warships; fleets of them could barely even slow down a single Ori Ship."
