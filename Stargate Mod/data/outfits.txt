	description "This data chip supposedly contains information on 12,000 star systems closest to this one: planets, ports, governments, trade prices, available services, etc. Unfortunately it seems to be limited, perhaps some sort of damage, it is over 10,000 years old after all. You can get all the same information just by exploring those systems yourself, but having a map can save you from making wrong turns if you are trying to travel through new territory to reach a certain system quickly."

	description "A hyperdrive allows a vessel to open a subspace window and move into hyperspace. In this manner, a ship can cross vast distances without experiencing relativity. Hyperdrives vary in their effectiveness from race to race, with some being much faster than others; most hyperdrives are designed to travel within a single galaxy, while more advanced models can travel between galaxies in the same amount of time. This is not one of them."

	description "The wormhole drive creates an artificial wormhole similar to that used by the Stargates, but with the exception that the wormhole does not require objects at either end for power or navigation, but rather the wormhole is sustained by the ship travelling through it. Because the ship using the drive—namely Atlantis—is shielded from the vacuum inside the wormhole, there is no need for a deconstruction/reconstruction interface at either end. This drive allows the vessel to travel between or throughout galaxies almost instantaneously."

	description "The technology behind the Faster-Than-Light drive has not been fully explained in detail, but does clearly does not function in the same manner as a hyperdrive. When engaged, the ship is quickly accelerated beyond the speed of light, in contrast to hyperdrive which opens a window into hyperspace. The drive's top speed has also not been made clear, though it has been shown to traverse an intergalactic void in a seemingly short amount of time. While the inter-galaxy FTL speed seems comparable to that of an intergalactic hyperdrive (a few weeks to cross a void in either case), the FTL's intra-galaxy speed is also shown as much slower (taking several years to cross a galaxy, instead of about a day). What also must be taken into consideration is the fact that the FTL drives shown on the first Destiny were heavily worn from millions of years of continuous use, so the drives top speed when it was newly constructed must have been a lot higher."
