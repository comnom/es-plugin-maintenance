	description "Drone weapons, known more colloquially as drones, are projectile weapons that serve as the primary weapon system of the Ancients. Drones are capable of penetrating the shields of Goauld Hatak class ships as well as the Ancient upgraded shields of Anubis' capital ship. A single drone can destroy most fighters and cause severe damage to smaller capital ships, while hundreds or thousands can obliterate dozens of vessels with little effort."

	description "This weapon appears to be designed for attacking larger spacecraft such as motherships, as it has no apparent means of aiming horizontally and fires at a much slower rate. However, its shots are clearly superior to those of the double-barreled turrets, based on the effects it had on the shields of the Nakai mothership compared to the smaller turrets."
