	description "The Ha'tak is a class of spaceship designed by the Goa'uld. During the reign of the Goa'uld empire in the Milky Way galaxy, the Ha'tak served as the main class of capital ship employed by most Goa'uld System Lords. During the height of the Goa'uld empire, the Ha'tak was among the most powerful vessels in the Milky Way, with hundreds having been positioned around the galaxy as to cement and project the power of the Goa'uld empire. Following the fall of the Goa'uld empire in 2005, the Ha'tak's presence in the galaxy endured, being adopted as the main battleship of the Free Jaffa Nation."

	description "This Ha'Tak design was made for the purpose of using the super weapon at it's center. Even though it takes a great amount of power it is absolutely deviating destroying anything within range. However, prolonged use can cause the weapon to overheat, not to mention drain one's power reserves rather quickly."
