	description "The Aurora-class battleship was a series of Lantean battleships used during the Lanteans' war with the Wraith. They are among the most advanced class of warships ever created. This class of ship was first encountered by the Atlantis expedition in 2005 in the form of the Aurora, with only four having been encountered since the fall of the Lanteans, excluding those built by the Asurans. Ships of the Aurora-class boast an arsenal of drone weapons capable of destroying a Wraith Hive ship in a single salvo. They are fired using a control chair. The drones themselves are released from a reservoir located on the top middle of the ship. Aurora-class ships feature at least 16 pulse weapon turrets placed around the ship, allowing for complete coverage of the vessel. While these weapons are far less effective than drone weapons, they are still capable of heavy damage."

	description "Not long after the creation of the Stargates, the Ancients discovered a pattern in the Cosmic microwave background radiation; recognizing that the pattern could not have been natural in origin, the Ancients concluded that its presence suggested an order to the universe never thought possible, possibly some kind of message. However, the message was fragmented and could not be recovered. To that end, they devoted the efforts of an entire generation to the construction of Destiny, the purpose of which was to find and reassemble the fragments, completing the message."

	description "Puddle Jumpers are small spacecraft created by the Ancients. Several of these ships were discovered in various hangars in Atlantis, and are used by the Atlantis expedition for various purposes. Puddle Jumpers feature retractable thrusters that allow them to travel through a Stargate, as well as powerful Drone weapons for self-defense and a cloaking device to avoid detection. They are operated via neural interface, and so the Ancient Technology Activation gene is required to activate and pilot the ship."
