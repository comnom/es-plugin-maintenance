	description "These white colored vessels are some of the largest ever encountered by Stargate Command being much larger than the Daedalus-class and Ha'tak vessels. They consist of an oval shaped structure with a large Stargate styled ring in the center which glows with a white light. Two engines are present at the back of the vessel. Though quite large, they were capable of entering a planet's atmosphere and landing, where they towered over the landscape."
